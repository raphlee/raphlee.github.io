### 1. Download Custom NDK via command

You can also open a terminal window in your 'SDK\tools\bin' folder... and type:

{: .box-note}
sdkmanager "ndk-bundle" "ndk;19.0.5232133"

This should download and install the required NDK version inside your SDK folder. You can later move it to another location or reference it from this one.
